- [ ] Up to 20 Tamago can be stored, but you can only have 2 at the beginning, must purchase [expansion slot 50g*n) (n is slots owned)
- [ ] Assemble your own Tamago, Name it
- [ ] Energy depletes per mini game
- [ ] Mini game rewards gold or energy based on conditions
- [ ] Energy can be renewed by caring for tamago (TBC)
- [ ] Inventory of Tamago and parts + loot boxes
- [ ] Tamago have rarity
- [ ] Higher rarity = more energy and more gold per game etc
- [ ] Rarity comes in common/uncommon/rare/epic/legendary

## Side Games
- [ ] Run (platformer style): just run and jump, dodge obstacles, don't fall in holes, collect coins. Every 10m run will give 1G, 20 coins will give 5G
- [ ] PREMIUM Ground Digging (gambling style) instead of using energy, uses gold to play. There are 25 spots on the ground to dig, toss 10G*n (n is the holes digged in a row, first dig is free) to dig a spot. All spots are filled as per: NOTHING (10 spots) or common Tamago part (5 spots) or uncommon Tamago part (3 spots) or 20G (3 spots) or rare Tamago part (1 spot) or epic Tamago part (1 spot) or legendary Tamago shard (1 spot, 2 shards to make 1 part), full energy refill (1 part) *note the numbers will be randomly generated, the max are shown in brackets)
- [ ] Mini game 3 (minesweeper style): 30 spots to dig, 5-10 bombs per game. If you get bombed you lose an extra energy bar, for every spot digged you will get 5G
- [ ] Energy Factory (rhythm style): this game is free to play. You gain energy bars by collecting dropping energy droplets, if you miss more than 3 drops or get hit by filling rocks 3 times, The game ends. Collect 10 for 1 bar.  The game follows a rhythm game with obstacles (press buttons at the correct time to collect energy)
- [ ] Mini game 5
